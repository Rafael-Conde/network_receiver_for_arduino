# Network Receiver to arduino

This project is only a part of a major project which I'm helping. This is meant to receive data through the internet and send it to an arduino through a serial port connection. 

# Work in progress

This repo is still work in progress and isn't nowhere near an usable state. It's still missing a lot of funcionality and also is in the test stage.
